An Oddworld-inspired network packet analyzer that visualizes network traffic as ingredients flowing through pipes. Security threats appear as contamination, allowing for intuitive monitoring of network health.

> **Note:** This project is in early development. The UI components are not yet functional. Currently, only the core backend systems and packet processing pipeline are implemented.

## Project Vision

Necronet reimagines network monitoring by representing:
- **Network Packets** as ingredients flowing through pipes
- **Connections** as pipes between systems
- **Security Threats** as contamination of ingredients
- **Network Devices** as industrial machinery

This visualization metaphor, inspired by the industrial aesthetic of Oddworld games, aims to make network monitoring more intuitive and engaging.

## Features

### Implemented
- âœ… High-performance packet capture engine
- âœ… Protocol parsers (HTTP, DNS, TCP/IP)
- âœ… Cross-platform IPC between components
- âœ… Threat detection engine with customizable rules
- âœ… Flow tracking and connection state monitoring
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite

### Planned/WIP
- ðŸš§ Visualization UI (Mudokon Command)
- ðŸš§ Real-time packet visualization
- ðŸš§ Security dashboard with threat indicators
- ðŸš§ Rule management interface
- ðŸš§ Capture filter configuration

## System Requirements

- **Zig 0.14.0** - Required to build the project
- **Windows or Linux** - Primary development platforms
- **libpcap/Npcap** - For packet capture functionality

## Architecture

Necronet consists of two main components:

- **Slig Barracks** (Backend)
  - Packet capture engine
  - Protocol analyzers
  - Flow tracking
  - Security monitoring

- **Mudokon Command** (Frontend) - *Not yet implemented*
  - Visualization interface
  - Security alerts dashboard
  - Network monitoring controls
  - Configuration interface

Components communicate via a custom IPC protocol that supports multiple transport mechanisms (Named Pipes, Sockets, Standard I/O) with both binary and JSON serialization options.

## Building the Project

1. Ensure Zig 0.14.0 is installed:
   ```bash
   zig version
   ```

2. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/necronet.git
   cd necronet
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   zig build
   ```

4. Run tests:
   ```bash
   zig build test
   ```

## Usage

Currently, only the backend components are functional. Running the analyzer (CLI mode):

```bash
zig build run -- --no-gui
```

## Development Status

Necronet is in early development with focus on building robust backend components:

- **Complete:** Core packet capture, protocol parsing, IPC system, detection engine
- **In Progress:** Visualization layer, UI components, configuration management
- **Planned:** Security dashboard, alert management, rule configuration interface

The UI components are currently a work in progress and not functional yet.
